## RL solving LQR with PPO
 The practice consists to model human movement data using a computational model fromoptimal control theory known as the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Therefore, there are  data from an experiment conducted in 2011 where participants were instructed to aim towards a very thin line, people try 5 different strategies, from very fast to very accurate. This experiment captures the so-called speed-accuracy tradeoff of human movement, where usually more precise movements will be slower.

In the repository, you will find the notebooks resolving the control problem and compare the solution with the one from PPO model.
